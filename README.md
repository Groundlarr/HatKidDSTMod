# Hat Kid: The Little Haberdasher

## Description
Hat Kid: The Little Haberdasher is a mod for Don't Starve Together, bringing Hat Kid and friends into The Constant! Featuring Hat Kid's signature hats, brand new custom badges, and more!

## Installation Instructions
I recommend installing the mod via the Steam Workshop, as it provides automatic updates, but you can also download one of the Releases, and unzip it inside your mods folder in your game's root directory.

## Configuration
This mod features extensive configuration options within the mod's configuration page. Most options should be self-explanatory. The mod is slightly over-tuned by default. 

## Features
* Hat Kid
* Bow Kid
* Awesome Hats
* Awesome Badges
* idk

## Compatibility
This mod was made for Don't Starve Together API version 10, which is the latest API version as of 5-15-2024 (i think). Using the mod on other versions of the game is at your own risk, and will probably crash your world.
