[h1]3.0.0 - Hat Kid Reloaded Overhaul

[h1]2.2.0 - The Hat Kid Update[/h1]
- Hat Kid's Sanity Aura has been reworked. It now has a much larger radius, covering most of Hat Kid's screen at all times, but is restores much less sanity. (20 per minute)
- Hat Kid's Sanity Aura is reduced to 50% of it's rate when she is below 50% sanity.
- Hat Kid's Sanity Aura is disabled when she is below 15% sanity.
- Hat Kid's Sanity Aura is doubled in sanity rate when she is sleeping.
- Changed Hat Kid's character select quote again.
- Hat Kid's character size has been boosted to 85% from 80%, making her easier to click by other players.
- Hat Kid's base speed has been reduced to 135% from 150%. This will be partly offset due to the character size increase, which increases speed by somewhere around 10%, however it is still a nerf.
- Hat Kid is now the only character allowed to use any of her hats, though I will only be applying this rule to the hats I rework, as well as the sprint hat and Kid's Hat. This means the other hats are still usable by other sfor the time being.
- The Sprint Hat now drains 1.75x hunger (from 1.6x) by default.
- Added mod config options to control the size and sanity rate of the new sanity aura.
- The Kid's Hat is now crafted out of 4 Beefalo Wool, and 2 Gold. Since other's can nolonger wear it, this is here to make it less expensive to recover your base hat in case of a fire or something else that loses you the hat.
- Updated about 100 of Hat Kid's speech lines to be unique.
- Fixed a bug were the Brewing Hat and Ice Hat could be crafted without prototyping.
- Fixed a bug were the Dweller Mask and Time Stop Hat could be crafted with a Prestihatitator.
