2.3.0 - The Ice Hat Update
This update is bringing a major change that will be put onto every hat, the new Ability System. By default, pressing the Z key will activate your hat's ability. Here, the Ice Hat is the first one to be reworked in this way.


- The Ice Hat is now infinite durability, but has a cooldown between uses, shown on the HUD specifically for Hat Kid.
- The Ice Hat now has an active ability! Press the ability key (default: LSHIFT) to chill nearby enemies by 3 frost levels, and damaging for 51! This will freeze most common enemies, allowing you to get away. 
- The Ice hat has an ability cooldown of 60 seconds.
- The Sprint Hat is now controled with the ability key, and will not consume hunger or speed you up while you aren't pressing it. This reduces macro between hats, since you won't lose hunger while not sprinting.
- The Sprint Hat's speed has been decreased to 1.3x by default.
- The Sprint Hat's hunger increase has been changed to 2x by default.
- The Brewing Hat's equipped sanity debuff has been reduced.
- The Brewinghat now has an active ability! Press the ability key to throw an explosive potion at your cursors position, dealing 68 damage to any monsters around it, as well as breaking certain structures.
- The Dweller Mask now has an active ability! Press the ability key to create an AOE around Hat Kid for 15 seconds. Without any badges, it will only provide light, as well as 1 sanity per second for 15 seconds. 
- The Dweller Mask has an ability cooldown of 60 seconds.
- The Time Stop Hat now has an activate ability! Press the ability key to slow down time, for everything but you for 6 seconds! 
- The Time Stop Hat has an ability cooldown of 180 seconds.
- Hat Kid's Sanity Aura now gradually decreases in effectiveness as she falls below 80% sanity, compeltely disabling when she goes insane (below 15% sanity).
- Hat Kid's hats are now ACTUALLY only usable by Hat Kid. I actually fixed it this time.
- Hat Kid's default speed has been reduced to be the same as Wilson, however this can still be changed to your own value in the Config.
- Hat Kid now deals only 90% damage, a 10% all round damage reduction. This is the act as some kindof nerf to her character so she isn't overly OP.
