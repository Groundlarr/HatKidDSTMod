[b]One Last Contract[/b]
Hat Kid always had her eye on home from the beginning. The huge adventure she'd just been on was more of a detour than anything to her, although it was quite necessary to make her way home. When a familiar friend presented an offer to accelerate that journey home, for just one last contract, she found the offer irresistable. Perhaps it was the strange ragtime music playing, or perhaps her reckless nature that lead her to ignore the fine print. Either way, the contract had been signed, beginning her second adventure, much different from her first.
